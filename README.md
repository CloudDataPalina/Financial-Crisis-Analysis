## 📂 Data Preprocessing
Before starting the analysis, a technical audit of the data was performed to ensure its accuracy and suitability for use:

📥 Data was loaded from a CSV file using pandas
🔍 Table structure, data types, missing values, and duplicates were checked
🧼 Numeric values were converted from int to float to improve calculation precision
🧾 Categorical values (indicators) were checked for uniqueness
📊 Descriptive statistics revealed sharp fluctuations in profit, indicating financial instability

All key preprocessing steps were successfully completed — the dataset is ready for full-scale analysis.

## ✅ Project Goals

1. Load and explore the dataset  
2. Compute and visualize profitability over time  
3. Analyze cost structure and debt accumulation  
4. Identify turning points and causes of collapse  
5. Derive actionable business insights

## 📈 Visualizations

The analysis includes the following key visualizations:

- 📊 **5-Year Dynamics of Key Indicators** — change in revenue, profit, and costs  
- 🥧 **Expense Structure in Year 5** — breakdown of final-year spending  
- 🔻 **Revenue vs. Expenses** — comparison of income vs cost growth  
- 📉 **Dynamics of Net Profit and Debt Load** — illustrating deepening losses and rising liabilities  
- 📈 **Financial Ratio Trends by Year** — Gross, Operating, and Net margin trends

 *All plots are available in [`analysis.ipynb`](analysis.ipynb).*

## 🔍 Key Findings

- Revenue declined by **38.5%** — indicating potential market share loss or shrinking demand  
- Net profit turned negative and fell nearly fourfold — confirming persistent losses  
- COGS rose despite declining revenue — signaling a drop in operational efficiency  
- Year-end debt increased **6.5×** — highlighting growing dependency on external financing  
- Admin and marketing expenses doubled — yet failed to produce revenue growth  
- All profitability margins (gross, operating, net) turned negative — confirming a deepening crisis

---

## 🧠 Key Hypotheses

- Loss of clients and contracts, decreasing demand, and growing competition  
- Poor cost control and inefficient marketing spending  
- Excessive borrowing to offset operational losses and liquidity issues

---

## 💡 Recommendations

- ✂️ **Cut overhead** — especially administrative and marketing expenses  
- 🔧 **Review COGS** — improve efficiency through supply chain audits  
- 💳 **Restructure debt** — freeze new borrowing, negotiate with creditors  
- 📌 **Focus on profitable segments** — shut down unprofitable operations  
- 📊 **Implement financial analytics** — enable data-driven decision-making

---

## 🧾 Conclusion

Technoprom Ltd. is undergoing a deep financial crisis and faces a high risk of bankruptcy if no corrective actions are taken. Only a strategic transformation — improving operational efficiency, reducing debt, and strengthening financial discipline — can stabilize the company and rebuild sustainable growth.
